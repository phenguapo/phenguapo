# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Phenguapo (aka Giorgos)
## About Me
I'm a college student diving headfirst into the world of programming. Currently, my main focus is JavaScript (through TheOdinProject), but I'm also training other languages like Python, C++, C. Balancing my programming pursuits, I'm a multifaceted individual with a range of hobbies that include photography, music creation, 3D art, and gaming.

### What I'm Up To
At the moment, I'm working diligently on expanding my portfolio by crafting various projects. To bring my ideas to life, I start by sketching rough visualizations of how I envision each project, jotting down notes alongside them. As a self-professed perfectionist, I'm driven by the pursuit of achieving the absolute best outcome for every endeavor I undertake, while also maintaining a healthy relationship with the project and not letting my perfectionism keep me back.
