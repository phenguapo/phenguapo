# 👋 Hi there! I'm Phenguapo (aka Giorgos)

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I'm a Computer Science student at **Hellenic Open University**, aiming to pursue a postgraduate degree in Cyber Security after graduation. I'm currently sharpening my skills through hands-on development and formal study, combining academic foundations with real-world engineering challenges.

By day, I work as a **Full-Stack Web Developer at Synergic Software**, where I architect and implement scalable e-commerce solutions (such as modules/plugins and full-on e-shops) with **Up-To-Date** technologies. By night, I continue to push my boundaries—learning, experimenting, and building.

I'm a perfectionist, but a practical one: I value excellence over obsession, and clarity over clutter. My process always begins with rough sketches and notes to envision functionality before touching a single line of code.

## ⚙️ What I'm Working On
- Building and optimizing full-stack applications with **React**, **Three.js**, and **Node.js**
- Prototyping interactive front-ends and performance-driven back-ends
- Expanding my knowledge in **OOP**, **algorithms**, and advanced Python
- Preparing a strong portfolio and academic track record for **postgrad studies**
- Developing tools and workflows to automate and scale creative ideas
- Expanding my professional scope and deepening my technical and collaborative capabilities
